# Autonomous-Line-Follower-with-Seeed-Shield-Bot-1.2-and-ARTe
The aim of this project is to create a rover that is able to independently follow a certain line path traced on the floor. The identification of the path is done by the five sensors integrated on the Shield Bot 1.2 rover. Also, a manual mode has been implemented, to drive through user's command, received via Serial line.
